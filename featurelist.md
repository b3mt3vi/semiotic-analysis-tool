Now that we have the foundation up and running, we can start expanding the features of your semiotic analysis tool. Here's a list of advanced features and steps we can implement that could be powerful for professional literary analysis, especially in post-grad study focusing on Clarice Lispector:

### Key Features for the Semiotic Analysis Tool:

#### 1. **Text & Semiotic Square Entry Forms**
   - **Goal**: Enable users to add texts and create semiotic squares via forms.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Create simple forms for entering text and associated semiotic terms (wet, dry, sveglia, etc.).
     - Allow the user to manually enter these relationships for new squares.

#### 2. **Mass Data Analysis of a Corpus**
   - **Goal**: Process large volumes of text (e.g., an entire corpus of Clarice Lispector) and generate semiotic squares automatically.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Text mining and natural language processing (NLP) integration.
     - Use NLP techniques to identify and suggest oppositions and neutral terms in new texts.
     - Display trends in how semiotic categories change across multiple texts.
     - Export functionality for results (e.g., CSV, JSON).

#### 3. **Dynamic Semiotic Square Manipulation**
   - **Goal**: Create an interactive semiotic square that updates in real-time based on user interactions.
   - **Implementation**:
     - A drag-and-drop interface where the user can manipulate terms on the square.
     - Automatically adjust related terms when a user modifies a term.
     - For example, moving "wet" could shift the relationships of "dry" or "not sveglia."

#### 4. **Textual and Semiotic Correlation**
   - **Goal**: Identify correlations between words/phrases and semiotic categories.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Add an analytical module to parse texts for recurring terms and map them onto the semiotic square.
     - For instance, when certain words associated with "wet" are frequent in a text, highlight them and suggest relationships.
     - Statistical tracking of semiotic term frequencies, with visual aids like heatmaps.

#### 5. **Analysis Recommendations and Automated Relationships**
   - **Goal**: Provide recommendations on potential semiotic oppositions or relationships based on textual patterns.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Machine learning algorithms that suggest new semiotic relations based on textual analysis (for advanced users).
     - Automated suggestions for related terms, filling in missing quadrants of the semiotic square based on patterns.
   
#### 6. **Visualization Tools**
   - **Goal**: Help users visualize the relationships between semiotic categories within a text.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Graph-based representations of how terms connect.
     - Color-coded squares to represent the strength of oppositions or neutral terms (based on frequency or patterns).
     - Exportable, publication-ready graphics for academic papers.

#### 7. **Corpus Comparison**
   - **Goal**: Analyze how different works in a corpus compare semiotically.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Perform a comparison of multiple works by Clarice Lispector.
     - Display how different texts use or vary the same semiotic relationships.
     - Allow side-by-side comparisons of texts or squares from different periods.

#### 8. **Search and Filter Functionality**
   - **Goal**: Quickly retrieve texts and squares based on specific terms or semiotic relationships.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Search function to filter texts and squares by keywords or semiotic categories (e.g., "wet," "dry").
     - Advanced filtering options to look for specific oppositions or neutral terms.

### Potential Benefits of This Tool for Post-Grad Study:
1. **Academic Insight**: 
   - It automates semiotic analysis, saving time and offering new ways of seeing relationships in texts that manual methods might miss.
   
2. **Corpus-Wide Analysis**: 
   - The ability to analyze a large number of texts in Lispectorâ€™s corpus will allow you to see how her semiotic themes evolve across her body of work.

3. **Interactive Exploration**: 
   - With interactive, real-time updates to the semiotic squares, this tool allows you to explore "what-if" scenarios in her texts, opening up new paths for interpretation.

4. **Advanced Visuals**: 
   - Graphical representation of semiotic relations can enhance presentations and papers, making your findings clearer and more impactful.

5. **Application of Modern Techniques**: 
   - By incorporating text mining and machine learning, you can bring cutting-edge computational techniques into the field of literary studies, demonstrating your technical skill alongside your literary expertise.

### Next Steps for Implementation:
1. **Build Forms for Text & Square Entry**:
   - Let's start by implementing forms for users to add texts and create semiotic squares.

2. **Add NLP for Text Processing**:
   - Incorporate basic text parsing and NLP techniques for identifying patterns in the texts.

3. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - Create a dynamic interface for manipulating the semiotic squares in real-time.
